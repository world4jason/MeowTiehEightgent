/**
 * Worker-side RPC host — runs inside the child process spawned by the host.
 *
 * This module is the worker-side counterpart to the server's
 * `PluginWorkerManager`. It:
 *
 * 1. Reads newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 requests from **stdin**
 * 2. Dispatches them to the appropriate plugin handler (events, jobs, tools, …)
 * 3. Writes JSON-RPC 2.0 responses back on **stdout**
 * 4. Provides a concrete `PluginContext` whose SDK client methods (e.g.
 *    `ctx.state.get()`, `ctx.events.emit()`) send JSON-RPC requests to the
 *    host on stdout and await responses on stdin.
 *
 * ## Message flow
 *
 * ```
 * Host (parent)                          Worker (this module)
 *   |                                        |
 *   |--- request(initialize) ------------->  |  → calls plugin.setup(ctx)
 *   |<-- response(ok:true) ----------------  |
 *   |                                        |
 *   |--- notification(onEvent) ----------->  |  → dispatches to registered handler
 *   |                                        |
 *   |<-- request(state.get) ---------------  |  ← SDK client call from plugin code
 *   |--- response(result) ---------------->  |
 *   |                                        |
 *   |--- request(shutdown) --------------->  |  → calls plugin.onShutdown()
 *   |<-- response(void) ------------------  |
 *   |                                        (process exits)
